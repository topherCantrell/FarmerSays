# Soda Machine

The price of the soda is 40 cents (a dime already in it). It takes
three coins (quarter, dime, dime) to get the soda. When you leave
the room, any coins you put in the machine pop out and roll to nearby 
rooms. The trick is to have a drop a coin in this room then come back
with one coin in each hand. Use left, user right, get right, use right.
The machine does not give change. It eats your change.
