## Misc Prompts

These are snagged from all-hands meetings with Rob Johnson.

> **miscOK:** OK.

> **miscNOP:** Nothing happens.

> **miscHandFull:** That hand already has something in it.

> **miscHandEmpty:** You aren't holding anything in that hand.

> **miscBounces:** {the name} bounces away into another room.

> **miscNoObj:** There is nothing to pick up.

## lobby (Al)

This is where you start. The exit is to the north. But Al's blood sugar is low and he can't press the button to let you out.
You must bring him the `soda` and use it. Then going north is a win.

## 1st\_hall (Justin)

## conference (Jacob)

The dime is in here, but it is stuck under the raisable desk. You must use the `wrench` to get it to raise. Then the `dime`
rolls out.

## cubes (Brockhaus)

Brockhaus sees your gun and challenges you to a play fight. He has the `wrench`. You must use the gun and he'll drop the `wrench`.
You don't need water in the gun. The threat is enough to get the `wrench`.

## break (Steve)

## vending (Eric)

You need the `soda` in oder for Al to let you out (to win). The price of the soda is 50 cents. A dime already is already in it. 
Thus it takes all three coins (`quarter`, `dime`, `nickel`) to get the `soda`. When you leave the room, any coins you put in 
the machine pop out and roll to nearby rooms. The trick is to drop a coin in this room first. Then come back with one coin in each 
hand. Use left, user right, get right, use right. When the `soda` is dropped, all the coins are gone from the game.

## lab (Russ)

Russ is dumpster diving here. You must `look` here to find the `quarter`

## 2nd\_landing (Topher)

There is a plant here that you can climb back and forth to the 3rd floor landing. You must squirt the plant twice with `watergun`. After
each squirt you must refill the `watergun` from the fixed water fountain. To climb the plant (either direction) you `use` a free hand.
The plant calls for water. It has three states: initial, middle, final. If can only climb the final state. If you water the final state
the plant withers back to initial.

## 2nd\_hall\_west (Larry)

The water fountain is here, but it is broken. If only you had a tool of some kind. Use the `wrench` to repair the fountain. Then you
can use the `watergun` here to refill it as often as you like.

## 2nd\_hall\_east (Donald)

## wenxiao (Wenxiao)

The `watergun` starts here. It starts out empty.

## 3rd\_landing (Alex)

## engineering (Brad)

Brad has the `kubelet` process. You need this to get the `nickel` from devops. Show brad the `dime`, and he'll give you the `kubelet` cluster.
Then Brad vanishes.

> **engDes.wav:** Welcome to engineering. All around you, you hear the frantic typing of software development. The 3rd floor
landing is to the WEST. This room continues to the EAST. 

> **engBrad.wav:** Brad Lanford is pacing nervously outside his cube and says, "I forgot my password! I know I used the name of the guy on the
dime, but what's his name? I can't remember!"

> **engShowDime.wav:** What have you got there? A DIME! Oh yeah ... "Roosevelt". How can I ever thank you? I know -- I have this extra Kubelet process. You are 
welcome to take it with you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to play some foosball.

> **kubeletShort.wav:** Kubelet

> **kubeletDesc.wav:** There is a Kubelet process resting against the wall.

## devops (Mike)

Mike Hoffman in devops is stuck in a beanbag chair and can't get up. You give him the `kubelet` and he'll give you the `nickel`. Then he vanishes.
The devops team can transport you (one way) to the `1st\_hall`. Use the `kubelet` to get sucked into the cloud and back out on the 1st floor. In
the process you drop the `kubelet` in the devops room (where you can use it again).
