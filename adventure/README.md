# Soda Machine

The price of the soda is 50 cents. A dime already is already in it. It takes
three coins (quarter, dime, nickel) to get the soda. When you leave
the room, any coins you put in the machine pop out and roll to nearby 
rooms. The trick is to drop a coin in this room then come back
with one coin in each hand. Use left, user right, get right, use right.
