| [introduction](webroot/audio/introduction.wav) | from John | @@It's a beautiful morning on the farm! You are sitting on the porch in your rocking chair watching the sun rise over the fields.

| [miscUseGun](webroot/audio/miscUseGun.wav) | tts Joanna | With a hearty "yeeee hawww!", you excitedly pump the trigger of the water gun. When the gun is finally empty, you look around to find that everything, including you, is soaking wet. Nice shootin', Tex! |
| [miscUseEmptyGun](webroot/audio/miscUseEmptyGun.wav) | Joanna | The empty water gun dribbles a drop or two onto your shoes. Maybe you can find some water to refill the gun. |
| [descPorch1](webroot/audio/descPorch1.wav) | tts Matthew | You are on the front porch. |
| [descPorch2](webroot/audio/descPorch2.wav) | tts Matthew | A lazy dog waits patiently for you to make breakfast. The kitchen is through a screen door to the East. The parlor is through the front door to the North. There is a large yard to the South. |
| [descParlor1](webroot/audio/descParlor1.wav) | tts Ivy | This is the parlor. |
| [descParlor2](webroot/audio/descParlor2.wav) | tts Ivy | An orange cat has plopped down on the couch in front of the TV. Her empty milk bowl is on the floor beside you. A door to the south leads to the front porch. |
| [getChurn](webroot/audio/getChurn.wav) | tts Ivy | The churn won't budge. |
| [startChurn](webroot/audio/startChurn.wav) | tts Ivy | You pour some of the milk into the cat's bowl. She jumps down and laps at it as you pour the rest of the milk into the churn. Then you vigorously work the churn's plunger. |

| [addedBread](webroot/audio/addedBread.wav) | tts Joey | You soaked four pieces of bread in the eggs while a pan was heating on the stove. Then you cooked the toast and stacked it onto a plate. |
| [youWon](webroot/audio/youWon.wav) | tts Joey | You slather the toast with fresh butter and syrup. Mmmmmmm. You carry the plate of toast and the dog's bowl out to the porch and sit down in your rocking chair beside the dog. You carefully place the top piece of toast in the dog's bowl and say, "Breakfast is served!". Congratulations! You won! |
| [followRecipe](webroot/audio/followRecipe.wav) | tts Joey | That is not what your famous recipe says to do. |
| [descEmptyBowl](webroot/audio/descEmptyBowl.wav) | tts Joey | There is an empty bowl on the counter. The recipe says: crack eggs into bowl and whisk until smooth. |

| [descYard1](webroot/audio/descYard1.wav) | tts Joanna | You are standing in a grassy yard. |
| [descYard2](webroot/audio/descYard2.wav) | tts Joanna | A large turkey struts around at your feet and pecks an old, dry corncob. The porch is to the north. A small stream babbles to the south. The barn is to the west. From the east, you smell the pigsty. |
| [turkeyGuards](webroot/audio/turkeyGuards.wav) | tts Joanna | The turkey thinks you are after his corncob! He chases you away before you can get the pail. |
| [turkeyFed](webroot/audio/turkeyFed.wav) | tts Joanna | You toss the fresh ear of corn to the turkey, and he attacks it hungrily. Good job: the pail is now unguarded! |
| [descPigsty1](webroot/audio/descPigsty1.wav) | tts Kimberly | Pee-yew! You are leaning on the fence of a smelly pigsty. You can go back West to the yard. |
| [descPigsty2](webroot/audio/descPigsty2.wav) | tts Kimberly | A fat pig grunts at you and rolls happily in the mud. |
| [descBarn1](webroot/audio/descBarn1.wav) | tts Salli | You are standing in the doorway of a large, red barn. A grassy yard is to the east. A vegetable garden is to the west. You hear chickens cackling to the north. A large pasture opens to the south. |
| [descBarn2](webroot/audio/descBarn2.wav) | tts Salli | A black and white dairy cow greets you with a moo and a swish of her tail. |
| [usePailCow](webroot/audio/usePailCow.wav) | tts Salli | You bang the pail against the side of the cow, and she moos at you in alarm. Maybe you should try a hands-on approach. |
| [milkCow](webroot/audio/milkCow.wav) | tts Salli | With a few gentle tugs, you have plenty of milk in your pail. |
| [alreadyHaveMilk:](webroot/audio/alreadyHaveMilk:.wav) |  | You overflow the pail with milk and some spills onto the ground. Oh well, no use crying over it. |
| [noPailCow:](webroot/audio/noPailCow:.wav) |  | That's the right idea, but you'll need something suitable to hold the milk. |
| [descGarden1](webroot/audio/descGarden1.wav) | tts Matthew | Your garden is coming in nicely. There are already a few ripe tomatoes, and the corn is ready to pick! |
| [descGarden2](webroot/audio/descGarden2.wav) | tts Matthew | A sleek, brown horse trots up to the fence opposite the garden. You walk over and give his neck a good scratching. You can see the barn to the east. |
| [shareCornHorse](webroot/audio/shareCornHorse.wav) | tts Matthew | You pick up the corn, break it in half, and share it with the horse. The horse nuzzles your face affectionately. |
| [descPasture1](webroot/audio/descPasture1.wav) | tts Justin | Several sheep are milling around near the edge of a large pasture. |
| [descPasture2](webroot/audio/descPasture2.wav) | tts Justin | Two lambs butt heads with each other and kick their back legs in the air playfully. The barn is back to the north. |
| [descCoop1](webroot/audio/descCoop1.wav) | tts Salli | You are standing before a large chicken coop. The barn is to the south. A large ramp from the coop lets the chickens come and go to roam freely about the farm. Hey! I bet there are fresh eggs in there! |
| [descCoop2](webroot/audio/descCoop2.wav) | tts Salli | But a crotchety old rooster guards the coop and won't let you collect the eggs. He cocks his head and clucks at you as if to say |
| [descCoop3](webroot/audio/descCoop3.wav) | tts Salli | If you could just distract him with something! |
| [useBalloon1](webroot/audio/useBalloon1.wav) | tts Salli | Oh, he likes that! He perked right up as if to say |
| [useBalloon3](webroot/audio/useBalloon3.wav) | tts Salli | You let it float from your hand, and he trots after it. While he is mesmerized, you collect a full basket of eggs from the chicken coop! |
| [useRoosterStuff1](webroot/audio/useRoosterStuff1.wav) | tts Salli | He isn't impressed. He appears to be deep in thought -- pondering deep issues like |
| [useRoosterStuff2](webroot/audio/useRoosterStuff2.wav) | tts Salli | You might try something colorful or shiny! |
| [sndRoosterGo](webroot/audio/sndRoosterGo.wav) | fx | "One of us has got to go!" |
| [useBalloon2](webroot/audio/useBalloon2.wav) | fx | "Well look what we got here!" |
| [sndRoosterCross](webroot/audio/sndRoosterCross.wav) | fx | "Why does a chicken cross the road?" |
| [descStream1](webroot/audio/descStream1.wav) | tts Kendra | You are on the mossy bank of a small stream. The cool water flows into a pond to your east. The yard is to the north. |
| [descStream2](webroot/audio/descStream2.wav) | tts Kendra | You startled a plump, green frog! He hops into the water -- completely submerged except for two yellow eyes that watch you anxiously. |
| [fillGun](webroot/audio/fillGun.wav) | tts Kendra | You dip the empty water gun into the cool stream and refill it. Look out world -- you've got squirting to do! |
| [gunIsFull](webroot/audio/gunIsFull.wav) | tts Kendra | Your water gun is already full. |
| [descPond1](webroot/audio/descPond1.wav) | tts Joey | You pause for a moment to gaze out over a large pond. A small stream feeds the pond from the west. There is a meadow to the east. |
| [descPond2](webroot/audio/descPond2.wav) | tts Joey | A green headed Mallard swims in and out of a clump of reeds looking for bugs. |
| [descMeadow1](webroot/audio/descMeadow1.wav) | tts Joanna | You are standing in a large meadow filled with tiny, yellow flowers. There is a large pond to the west. A path north leads to a giant Oak tree. |
| [coyoteSnaps](webroot/audio/coyoteSnaps.wav) | tts Joanna | The coyote snaps at you, but you back off just in time. He doesn't chase you, but it's clear you aren't going north with that coyote there! |
| [coyoteRuns](webroot/audio/coyoteRuns.wav) | tts Joanna | The coyote takes one look at your water gun and yelps and flees into the woods. You give the gun a couple of squirts to show you mean business! You wait a couple of long minutes, but the coyote doesn't return. The path north looks safe now. Great job! |
| [descCoyote](webroot/audio/descCoyote.wav) | tts Joanna | A big, bad, brown coyote hunches over the path leading north. He snarls at you and drools. Let's not go that way, please! |
| [descTree1](webroot/audio/descTree1.wav) | tts Kimberly | You are standing beneath the limbs of a very old Oak tree that towers over this end of the meadow. A footpath leads south to the meadow. |
| [descTree2](webroot/audio/descTree2.wav) | tts Kimberly | A bright red bird is perched on the limb directly above you. He is happily whistling a tune for the whole world to enjoy. And you pause a minute to enjoy it. |
