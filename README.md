# The Farmer Says

This is what it looks like opened up.

When you pull the string it winds a motor that spins the pointer as it unwinds. The
center gear (on the right) has a nub that presses buttons on the circuit board (on
the left):

# Accessing the switches

The rubber ring holds switches that press down onto finger pads on the circuit board. Each pad has an exposed
metal test point. I drilled a hole in the board and soldered wires to the test pads. The red wire is the
common connection to all the switches.

I used an exacto knife to cut all the traces from the switches to the original circuit:

I used superglue to hold the wires in place on the bottom of the board:

Then I replaced the rubber switch ring completing the board.
